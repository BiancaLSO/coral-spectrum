# Meet Coral Spectrum

Coral Spectrum is a JavaScript library of Web Components following Spectrum design patterns.

## Spectrum

The current default theme is is an implementation of the [Spectrum](https://adobe.design) design 
specifications, Adobe’s design system. Spectrum provides elements and tools to help product teams work more 
efficiently, and to make Adobe’s applications more cohesive.
 
Coral Spectrum leverages the [Spectrum CSS](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css) framework to style 
components including the Spectrum SVG icons. 

## Angular, React, Vue.js compatibility

Our vision is to create consistent Adobe experiences by providing a complete, easy to use library of HTML components 
compatible with [major frameworks](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

To reach the goal, Coral Spectrum derives from [Custom Elements v1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html) with 
[native support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) thanks to broad collaboration between browser vendors. 
The use of custom elements gives us the ability to hide many implementation details from the consumer, allowing much 
more freedom to change the underlying markup that supports those elements. 
This makes the exposed API smaller and more explicit, resulting in a lower risk of updates to Coral Spectrum needing to 
introduce breaking changes.

## Showcase

All components can be seen in action <a href="../examples" target="_blank">here</a>. These are only examples and 
don't cover all scenarios. The API documentation can be found in the <a href="./identifiers.html" target="_blank">references</a>.    
A playground is available <a href="../playground" target="_blank">here</a> to experiment and preview code with the latest Coral Spectrum version.
Code can be shared by copy pasting the URL. The playground is sandboxed to prevent security risks.
