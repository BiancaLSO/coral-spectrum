**A JavaScript library of Web Components following Spectrum design patterns.**

Our vision is to create consistent Adobe experiences by providing a complete, easy to use library of HTML components 
compatible with [major frameworks](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

Coral Spectrum derives from [Custom Elements v1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html) with 
[native support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) thanks to broad collaboration between browser vendors. 
The use of custom elements gives us the ability to hide many implementation details from the consumer, allowing much 
more freedom to change the underlying markup that supports those elements. 
This makes the exposed API smaller and more explicit, resulting in a lower risk of updates to Coral Spectrum needing to 
introduce breaking changes.

The current default theme is is an implementation of the [Spectrum](http://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/) design 
specifications, Adobe’s design system. Spectrum provides elements and tools to help product teams work more 
efficiently, and to make Adobe’s applications more cohesive.

Coral Spectrum leverages the [Spectrum CSS](http://spectrum-css.corp.adobe.com/) framework to style 
components including the Spectrum SVG icons. 
To request new icons, please follow the instructions listed on http://icons.corp.adobe.com. Ideally, the icon team 
should be creating or reviewing every icon for every Adobe experience.
