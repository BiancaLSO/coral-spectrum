This package contains a polyfill for [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame) furthermore it will integrate the use of requestAnimationFrame into jQuery's [$.animate()](http://api.jquery.com/animate/) function. This will help improving the performance of jQuery based animations without the need of modifying any animation configuration.
